"Thousands of people have either already completed or signed up for the Monarca network’s legal observer trainings—they fill to capacity quickly, but keep an eye on the website, as new ones are often added. Some of the resources (like signage that were previously available on their website, are no longer accessible, though they still have their rapid response line (612-441-2881). ",,,,

They're taking a break on Friday January 23 due to the sub-zero temps, but will be back at it last week. And remember, as they say via their Facebook, there are many ways to support the food shelf: TLDR is cash is king, think long-term, and space out your donations. ",,,,

,,,,
Restaurants and Businesses to Support,,,,
"One of the most-asked questions I’ve seen circulating on social media is: What businesses have been hit hardest by ICE’s presence, so we can support them?",,,,
,,,,
" In short, the answer is: immigrant-owned restaurants who have large immigrant customer bases. I can’t draft up an exact and comprehensive list, much as I wish I could, but I can give you a place to start based on some of my favorites:",,,,
•       Go for lunch at Mercado Central and get pupusas at Rincón Salvadoreño and apple turnovers from ground-floor bakery Panaderia El Mexicana; pick up a pressure cooker that’ll likely knock the socks off your Instant Pot.,,,,
"•       For sweets: My favorites are rice pudding-filled doughnuts from Panaderia San Miguel; conchas and apricot-glazed hilos from Papá Chuy’s; halwo and vanilla cake from Albi Kitchen (also the sambusas here are great); malawax (sweet crepes) from Karmel Mall (yes, Hamdi is  excellent, but if you wander around the ground floor you’ll find a number of other stalls selling their own equally delicious versions).",,,,
"•       For dinner: salmon and spaghetti at Mama Safia’s; smoky pozole from Habanero Tacos Street on Lake Street; Homi Restaurant’s entire caldos menu over in St. Paul; 18-inch, pastor-filled machetes from Taco Libre; fried tilapia and pilaf rice at Wiilo Restaurant & Bakery in Karmel Mall; pork belly gorditas at El Taco Torro in Midtown Global Market. For tacos: True Jalisco-style quesabirria at Taco Taxi; tacos de canasta at Las Charolas on the ground floor of Plaza Mexico and barbacoa de chivo at El Chivo Crazy just upstairs; tacos al pastor at Taqueria La Hacienda. If you’re feeding a crowd, Tacos El Primo does amazing catering-sized meals. ",,,,
"A key note, though. As you’re visiting and eating, please don’t take photos—given the very scary and inflammatory nature of the moment, doing so could potentially make staff or customers feel unsafe. ",,,,
,,,,
Restaurant Closures,,,,
"Unfortunately, ICE’s presence throughout the metro has caused a number of restaurants and businesses to temporarily close to prioritize the safety and well-being of their employees. Because things are changing so fast, we're no longer listing those that are closing for a couple of days at a time or have changed their hours—there's simply too much to keep track of.",,,,
,,,,
"The below restaurants, though, are closed until further notice—the best way to support these places is to show up and eat there as soon as they reopen. ",,,,
"Valerie’s Carniceria and Alborada Market are now open after closing for several days, go shop there!",,,,
