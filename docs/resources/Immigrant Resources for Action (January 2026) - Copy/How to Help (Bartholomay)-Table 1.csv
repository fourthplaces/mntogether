"At a time when misinformation, racism, and fear too often dominate the narrative about immigration, each of us has a role to play in building a more welcoming community and resisting an increasingly violent and militarized federal government. Standing with immigrants and refugees doesn’t require being an expert or doing everything at once; it starts with small, consistent actions that build collective power",,,,
,,,,
"While it can feel overwhelming and impossible to make a difference, remember that you have the power to be a catalyst of change within our community. Here’s a list compiled by ILCM staff on meaningful ways you can show up, speak out, and make a real impact:",,,,
,,,,
1) ,,,,
Stay Informed.,,,,
"Follow us on Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn for the latest immigration news and updates. You can also visit a local library or prioritize news from credible sources with transparent practices. Even reading one article a day helps you stay informed and better prepared to combat misinformation and harmful rhetoric.",,,,
,,,,
2) ,,,,
Speak Up and Speak Out. ,,,,
"Talk to friends and family, and to members of your civic and religious groups about immigrants and refugees. While it may be a difficult conversation, especially if they may not be receptive or believe misleading content, we have some tips on Talking About Immigration for help!",,,,
,,,,
3) ,,,,
Join a Legal Observer or Bystander Training. ,,,,
"Sign up for a training session on what to do if you witness ICE activity. Groups like Monarcha and Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee (MIRAC) regularly host these trainings, so you’re prepared and know your rights if you encounter ICE as a bystander. If you live outside the Twin Cities, look to your local immigrant justice organizers for opportunities.",,,,
"If you’re a US citizen, you can act as a legal observer if you see ICE or other federal agents questioning someone in public. Even if you’re not trained, here’s what you can do at the moment:",,,,
"• If you see something, record it. Try to document the harm they are causing to our community.",,,,
• Know your rights. You may document and record enforcement activity from a safe distance.,,,,
• Send your documentation to organizations and call for help:,,,,
"o Call the Unidos Monarca Rapid Response Line at (612) 441-2881, who will send trained responders to witness federal activity in our communities.",,,,
o Call the Immigrant Defense Network helpline at (612) 255-3112 immediately if you witness activity or a family/neighbor is impacted and needs support.,,,,
,,,,
4) ,,,,
Support Organizations Providing Legal Services. ,,,,
"Yes, that includes us – the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota! Financial support through gifts helps ensure immigrants and refugees have access to legal aid, educational support, and advocacy. We’re proud to be part of a strong Minnesotan network of legal aid organizations doing this work and making a powerful impact, which includes: Advocates for Human Rights, International Institute of Minnesota, Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, Southern Minnesota Regional Legal Services, and Volunteer Lawyers Network.",,,,
 ,,,,
5) ,,,,
Write Letters to the Editor. ,,,,
"Letters published in local newspapers show your community that immigrants and refugees have strong, visible support. Share speeches, quotes, and articles that push back on anti-immigrant rhetoric.",,,,
,,,,
6) ,,,,
Call your Representatives.,,,,
"Changing national policy is the single most important way to help immigrants and refugees. While it won’t happen overnight, pick one issue each week and commit to calling regularly. Tell your representatives to support compassion, not detention, and that you believe in a path to legalization and citizenship for all immigrants. That immigrants enrich our communities, strengthening our nation by sharing their unique skills, experiences, and cultural practices.",,,,
Phone calls are more effective than letters or petitions. You can find your representatives in the Minnesota Legislature website.,,,,
,,,,
7) ,,,,
Join with Others. ,,,,
"Go to a rally or protest, invite friends over to watch a movie about immigrants and refugees, take a friend to a benefit event—commitment shared brings strength and energy for the struggle.",,,,
Share on Social Media. ,,,,
"Your voice matters. Amplify immigrant voices. Share stories and artwork by immigrants, support immigrant-owned businesses, and engage with media that highlights their experiences. Push back against misinformation, share resources, and show that supporting immigrant and refugees is important to you.",,,,
9) ,,,,
Volunteer. ,,,,
Be a resource. Become a pro bono legal volunteer. Other volunteering opportunities are available with the following organizations that align closely with ILCM’s values: ,,,,
• Advocates for Human Rights Court Observation Project ,,,,
• Conversations with Friends ,,,,
• National Lawyers Guild ,,,,
• REP Hotline,,,,
,,,,
