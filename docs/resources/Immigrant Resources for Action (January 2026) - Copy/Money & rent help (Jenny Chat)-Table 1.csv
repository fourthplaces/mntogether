,,,,,,,,,,,
"For the immigrant families that are in hiding , they’re afraid to work because of ICE. They don’t bring in a paycheck . They can’t pay the rent . Are there any organizations in MN or at a federal level that will give them money to take care of the rent ?",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes — there are organizations and resources in Minnesota and nationally that can help immigrant families in crisis, including with rent, utilities, food, supplies, and referrals, even if the families are afraid to go out because of ICE. Many are community-based and not dependent on federal immigration status. Here’s a breakdown of what exists and how people can access help:",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
🧡 Community & Mutual Aid Funds (Direct Help),,,,,,,,,,,
"These types of grassroots funds are specifically collecting money now. Donations go directly to help families cover rent, utilities, groceries, and basic needs:",,,,,,,,,,,
North Star Mutual Aid — fundraiser specifically raising money for immigrant families in the Twin Cities to cover rent and utilities during this crisis.,,,,,,,,,,,
Inquilinxs Unidxs / ZACAH partnership — organizing rental assistance funds for members and families in need.,,,,,,,,,,,
"GoFundMe relief funds — individual community-run campaigns in Minnesota providing emergency support for rent, groceries, utilities, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,
These mutual aid efforts often distribute money or goods quickly and do not require immigration status verification. They are based on community support.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Local Organizations Providing Support & Referrals,,,,,,,,,,,
"These groups don’t necessarily give cash directly but can connect families to resources, legal help, casework, and sometimes emergency assistance:",,,,,,,,,,,
Minnesota Organizations,,,,,,,,,,,
"Immigrant Defense Network – statewide coalition of immigrant, labor, legal, faith, and community groups providing rapid-response support, legal referrals, and community organizing.",,,,,,,,,,,
"International Institute of Minnesota – long-standing immigrant service provider offering legal support, information, and humanitarian services.",,,,,,,,,,,
"Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota – free immigration legal representation and referrals; not a rent fund, but can help with legal options which may make it safer to seek other community services.",,,,,,,,,,,
"Source MN (Immigrant Outreach) – offers food, food deliveries, emergency housing support, and set-up housing and rent support funds through its volunteer network.",,,,,,,,,,,
These agencies do not provide federal immigration enforcement information to ICE and are focused on community assistance.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
📞 County & Local Public Help,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even if families fear government programs, calling a neutral referral line can connect them with nonprofits and charities that offer rent help:",,,,,,,,,,,
"211 Hotline — Free, confidential, and available nationwide. A specialist can connect callers to local nonprofit rent assistance, housing support, food resources, and financial help without directly triggering immigration enforcement.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
🍞 Other Non-Federal Financial Options,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because most federal cash benefits (like SSI, TANF, SNAP, HUD rental vouchers, etc.) typically require certain immigration statuses and may be inaccessible for undocumented folks, families should focus on community and charity support:",,,,,,,,,,,
Faith-based organizations and local churches often operate emergency rent funds or direct cash support.,,,,,,,,,,,
Mutual aid networks and local nonprofits raise community funds for people in need — usually quick and non-bureaucratic.,,,,,,,,,,,
"Private foundations (e.g., Harvest of Hope Foundation) offer grants to migrant families and workers (nationally, may require applications).",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
⚠️ Important Notes,,,,,,,,,,,
"Federal cash assistance eligibility: Most federal housing or cash programs (e.g., HUD housing assistance, SNAP, TANF) typically require documented status and are not available to many undocumented immigrants. This is a general rule in current policy.",,,,,,,,,,,
"Emergency FEMA programs (after major disasters) may have some short-term non-cash support regardless of status, but this applies only to declared disasters and is not a regular rent assistance program.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
🏘️ What You Can Do Now,,,,,,,,,,,
Here’s how families or allies can act today:,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Reach out to mutual aid funds — donate or help spread word so funds hit families quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Call 211 (or local human services) for referrals to nonprofits with emergency rent money.,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Contact local immigrant support groups (listed above) for legal and casework help that can connect to other supports.,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Connect with faith/community food programs — many also offer emergency small financial grants.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
🧡 If You Want to Help Them,,,,,,,,,,,
If you’re asking for someone else and want to support neighbors in hiding:,,,,,,,,,,,
Share or donate to community funds (mutual aid and rent relief GoFundMes).,,,,,,,,,,,
Volunteer to deliver food or essentials so families don’t have to leave home. (This is already happening informally in the community.),,,,,,,,,,,
Connect them with safe contact points — trusted nonprofits or 211 can be safer bridges than direct government offices.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
