## Active Plan

**📍 [2026-01-27-mvp-execution-plan.md](./2026-01-27-mvp-execution-plan.md)** - THE current execution plan

This is the authoritative plan. It uses a spike-based approach to ship value incrementally:
- **SPIKE 1**: Need discovery pipeline + display (2 days)
- **SPIKE 2**: Simple volunteer intake (1 day)
- **SPIKE 3**: AI chat (optional, 2 days)

Timeline: **3-5 days to shippable MVP**

## Archived Plans

**[ARCHIVED-2026-01-27-comprehensive-plan.md](./ARCHIVED-2026-01-27-comprehensive-plan.md)** - Superseded comprehensive plan

This was the original 15-17 day plan that assumed building everything upfront. It's preserved for reference but is no longer the active plan. The spike-based approach replaced it after realizing SPIKE 1 alone delivers a useful product.
